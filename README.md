# Mastermind
The program only works for N = 4 so dont change that unless u can update it.
You can add as many colours as you want just that it will take longer to give a response.
The games file is for you to play Mastermind on it. Give the program your feedback with a space in between in the form of:Red Red Red Red
Make sure to put the feedback in order of reds then whites then blanks or else it wont work.
The file other file, not for games runs a simulation of the program against all possible codes and gives u the distribution of the number of guesses it took. It takes quite long. 
It is pretty op if you use it against other ppl u probably shldnt
